            RS/JSON schemas expected a <code>version</code> attribute. Here is an example:

            Versioning in RS/JSON has 2 objectives:
        </rs-paragraph>
        <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>Giving your the opportunity to propose incremental changes to your schema</li>
            <li>Let the migration engine aware of changes and take decisions</li>
        </ul>
        <rs-paragraph>
            Incremental changes let your collegues know what kind of changes you operated on your schema, according to <a href="https://semver.org/" target="blank">semantic versioning</a> principles. This means, if you operated a patch, and your upgrade version from <code>0.1.0</code> to <code>0.1.1</code>, your collegues can figure out it is a fix which has no impact on their data or their app.
        </rs-paragraph>
        <rs-paragraph>
            Migrations engines will take this version into account and operates changes only if the difference between the actual schema and the previous schema is about a minor improvement or a patch. If it is a major improvement, for example from <code>1.4.3</code> to <code>2.0.0</code>, the migration will not operate. With RS/JSON, we want to bring the same advantages we have on code versioning, but for database schemas.
